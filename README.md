# My Personal Software Developer Profile
### Introduction:

The project is a personal website that showcases my programming projects, skills, and interests. The purpose of the website is to create an online presence that can serve as a platform to showcase my work and share my passion for programming. Through this website, I hope to connect with other developers, potential clients, and employers, and to establish myself as a competent and knowledgeable programmer. The website features a clean and modern design, and is divided into four main sections: Home, About/ Education, Projects, and Contact. Each section provides different information about me and my work, and allows visitors to learn more about my background and experience, view my projects, and get in touch with me.
Mention that this README provides information on the source code for the four sections that make up the website.
