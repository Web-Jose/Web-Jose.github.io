    "description": "This code is a C++ program that measures the runtime of three sorting algorithms - Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort. The program generates an array of 10,000 random integers and then creates copies of the array to be sorted by each algorithm. The program prints the unsorted and sorted arrays and reports the runtime of each sorting algorithm using the high_resolution_clock from the chrono library. The program also stores the runtime data for later use.",
