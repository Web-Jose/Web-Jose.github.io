            Right now, I'm in the midst of working on my own portfolio website,
            and I'm using HTML and CSS to bring it to life. Although I'm
            completely new to both of these languages, I'm feeling really
            excited about the prospect of learning them and creating something
            that truly reflects my skills and interests. I'm looking forward to
            continuing to work on my website and sharpening my abilities in the
            process. My hope is that this website will be a valuable tool for
            showcasing my work and helping me achieve my goals.

              <p>
                Hi there! My name is Jose Cortes, and I'm from Madera,
                California. I'm a 3rd-year computer science undergraduate at the
                California State University of Fresno, and my passion for coding
                has led me to work on various personal projects to improve my
                skills. Although I don't have any professional experience yet, I
                have developed proficiency in languages such as HTML, CSS, and
                C++.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I also possess strong
                accounting skills, including bookkeeping and financial analysis.
                My experience in data entry and management, coupled with strong
                organizational and time management abilities, allow me to be a
                valuable asset in any team.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to work, I enjoy problem-solving and creative
                projects that challenge me to think outside the box. I'm
                inspired by the people in my life who motivate me to work harder
                and aim higher. In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies,
                such as 3D modeling, playing Pok√©mon, embroidery, coding,
                photography, and listening to music.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can find me on my
                socials, or you can send me an email or fill out the contact
                form at the bottom of this page.

              CSCI 1 - Critical Thinking and Computer Science: In this course, I
              gained an overview of the field of computer science with a focus
              on critical thinking skills. I learned problem-solving strategies,
              algorithm design, and data abstraction, as well as gained an
              introduction to hardware and theoretical limitations of computers.
              Additionally, the course explored issues that arise from the
              growing role of computers in society. By taking this course, I
              developed critical thinking skills and an understanding of the
              impact of technology on society.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSCI 40 - Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving: In this
              course, I was introduced to problem solving and algorithm
              development using a high-level programming language. I learned
              about procedural and data abstraction, program design, coding,
              debugging, testing, and documentation. After taking this course, I
              had developed basic programming skills and was able to design and
              implement simple programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSCI 41 - Introduction to Data Structures: This course built on
              the programming skills I developed in CSCI 40 and covered
              programming methodology, program correctness, and review of data
              types. The course focused on data structures such as linear and
              nonlinear structures, files, and recursion. I learned about
              searching and sorting, as well as implementation of data
              structures. By taking this course, I developed an understanding of
              fundamental data structures and the ability to design and
              implement more complex programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSCI 60 - Foundations of Computer Science: In this course, I
              gained a foundation for further study in computer science. I
              learned about abstraction, iteration, induction, recursion,
              complexity of programs, data models, and logic. After taking this
              course, I had developed a strong theoretical understanding of
              computer science, which may help me to design more efficient and
              effective programs in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, each of these courses provided valuable skills and
              knowledge for my portfolio, from problem-solving strategies and
              programming methodology to an understanding of the impact of
              technology on society.

                  Bubble Sort. The program generates an array of 10,000 random
                  integers and then creates copies of the array to be sorted by
                  each algorithm. The program prints the unsorted and sorted
