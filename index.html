            Right now, I'm in the midst of working on my own portfolio website,
            and I'm using HTML and CSS to bring it to life. Although I'm
            completely new to both of these languages, I'm feeling really
            excited about the prospect of learning them and creating something
            that truly reflects my skills and interests. I'm looking forward to
            continuing to work on my website and sharpening my abilities in the
            process. My hope is that this website will be a valuable tool for
            showcasing my work and helping me achieve my goals.

                Hi there! My name is Jose Cortes. I'm a 3rd-year computer
                science undergraduate at the California State University of
                Fresno, and my passion for coding has led me to work on various
                personal projects to improve my skills. Although I don't have
                any professional experience yet, I have developed proficiency in
                languages such as HTML, CSS, and C++.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I also possess strong
                accounting skills, including bookkeeping and financial analysis.
                My experience in data entry and management, coupled with strong

                When it comes to work, I enjoy problem-solving and creative
                projects that challenge me to think outside the box. I'm
                inspired by the people in my life who motivate me to work harder
                and aim higher. In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies,
                such as 3D modeling, playing Pok√©mon, embroidery, coding,

            <div class="Courses">
              <p>CSCI 1 - Critical Thinking and Computer Science</p>
              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I gained an overview of the field of computer
                science with a focus on critical thinking skills. I learned
                problem-solving strategies, algorithm design, and data
                abstraction, as well as gained an introduction to hardware and
                theoretical limitations of computers. Additionally, the course
                explored issues that arise from the growing role of computers in
                society. By taking this course, I developed critical thinking
                skills and an understanding of the impact of technology on
                society.

              <p>CSCI 40 - Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving</p>
              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I was introduced to problem solving and
                algorithm development using a high-level programming language. I
                learned about procedural and data abstraction, program design,
                coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. After taking this
                course, I had developed basic programming skills and was able to
                design and implement simple programs.
              </div>

              <p>CSCI 41 - Introduction to Data Structures</p>
              <div class="Info">
                This course built on the programming skills I developed in CSCI
                40 and covered programming methodology, program correctness, and
                review of data types. The course focused on data structures such
                as linear and nonlinear structures, files, and recursion. I
                learned about searching and sorting, as well as implementation
                of data structures. By taking this course, I developed an
                understanding of fundamental data structures and the ability to
                design and implement more complex programs.

              <p>CSCI 60 - Foundations of Computer Science</p>
              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I gained a foundation for further study in
                computer science. I learned about abstraction, iteration,
                induction, recursion, complexity of programs, data models, and
                logic. After taking this course, I had developed a strong
                theoretical understanding of computer science, which may help me
                to design more efficient and effective programs in the future.

            The PokeGear Radio project is a music player with a Pokemon theme
            that plays songs from different regions in the main pokemon games
            based on the position of the selector. The project consists of an
            HTML file that defines the structure of the page, a CSS file for
            styling, a SongPlayer.js file for setting up the audio player and
            handling song selection and playback, and a Selector.js file that
            implements a draggable selector on a globe graphic to change the
            region from which songs are played. Users will be able to listen to
            Pokemon music, control playback using buttons, and drag the globe
            selector to play songs from different regions. The music player will
            randomly select songs to play, and users can loop songs, skip to the
            next song, and adjust the volume. The clock will also update in
            real-time.

              <p>CSCI 1 - Critical Thinking and Computer Science</p>
              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I gained an overview of the field of computer
                science with a focus on critical thinking skills. I learned
                problem-solving strategies, algorithm design, and data
                abstraction, as well as gained an introduction to hardware and
                theoretical limitations of computers. Additionally, the course
                explored issues that arise from the growing role of computers in
                society. By taking this course, I developed critical thinking
                skills and an understanding of the impact of technology on
                society.

              <p>CSCI 40 - Introduction to Programming</p>
              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I was introduced to problem solving and
                algorithm development using a high-level programming language. I
                learned about procedural and data abstraction, program design,
                coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. After taking this
                course, I had developed basic programming skills and was able to
                design and implement simple programs.

              <p>CSCI 41 - Introduction to Data Structures</p>
              <div class="Info">
                This course built on the programming skills I developed in CSCI
                40 and covered programming methodology, program correctness, and
                review of data types. The course focused on data structures such
                as linear and nonlinear structures, files, and recursion. I
                learned about searching and sorting, as well as implementation
                of data structures. By taking this course, I developed an
                understanding of fundamental data structures and the ability to
                design and implement more complex programs.

              <div class="Info">
                In this course, I gained a foundation for further study in
                computer science. I learned about abstraction, iteration,
                induction, recursion, complexity of programs, data models, and
                logic. After taking this course, I had developed a strong
                theoretical understanding of computer science, which may help me
                to design more efficient and effective programs in the future.
